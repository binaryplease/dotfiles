# Installation

## Setup

To setup the dotfiles on a new system run the setup script using:

```bash
bash <(curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binaryplease/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh)
```

## Deprecation

I'm in the process of migrating my dotfiles management to a ansible-based
workflow. The new repo is located
[here](https://github.com/binaryplease/dotfiles-ansible/) for now. At the moment
it is WIP, as soon as its ready I will this old repository in favor of the new
one.
